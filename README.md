## About Project 👋

This app is just a practice React project, at using tailwind, and framer motion, it is a generic website.

Created with Vite

---

## Features & How it works

- All the components are mainly presentational components that dont have any special functionality. When the user scrolls into view certain components, an animation will trigger. Faq.jsx only has one state that toggles on/off between opening the question/answer and closing
